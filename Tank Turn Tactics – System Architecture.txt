Document
Version 1.1
Date: [Insert Date]

1. Overview
Project Name: Tank Turn Tactics
Objective: Develop a real-time, multiplayer turn-based strategy game where players compete on a dynamic 20x20 grid.

Key Goals:
- Implement robust game logic and mechanics (movement, shooting, upgrades, revivals, etc.).
- Provide a seamless real-time experience through effective communication between the frontend and backend.
- Ensure scalability and reliability through containerization and orchestration.

2. High-Level Architecture
The system architecture is divided into the following key layers:
- Frontend: User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) components for game interaction and user account management.
- Backend/Game Engine: Core game logic, real-time processing, API services, and authentication.
- Data Layer: Persistent storage (databases), caching (Redis), and logging.
- Deployment & Orchestration: Containerization, CI/CD, and Kubernetes for production deployment.
- Monitoring & Logging: Tools for performance monitoring and error tracking.

3. Detailed Components
3.1. Frontend
Technology Stack:
- Framework: React with Vite for a fast development environment.
- Styling: TailwindCSS and/or ShadeCN UI for rapid and responsive UI development.
- State Management: Context API or libraries like Redux Toolkit/Recoil for managing game state, user interactions, and authentication status.

Key Features:
- Game Board Interface: Real-time grid display showing player positions and status.
- Action Menu: For movements, shooting, upgrading range, and trading actions.
- Chat System: Global and one-to-one messaging similar to WhatsApp for alliances and betrayals.
- History View: Display of previous moves (similar to chess.com move history).
- User Authentication: Login, sign-up, and session management forms for secure user access.

Interaction Flow:
The frontend communicates with backend APIs and WebSocket endpoints for real-time game updates and authentication requests. User sessions and authentication tokens are managed on the client side to secure access and protect user data.

3.2. Backend/Game Engine
Technology Stack:
- Framework: Express.js with Node.js for handling API requests, real-time communication, and authentication services.
- Core Game Logic: Implementation of game mechanics such as movement, action point (AP) accumulation, health, revivals, and board shrinkage.

Key Components:
- Game Logic Module: Implements rules for player actions, turn processing, and state updates.
- API Layer: RESTful and/or WebSocket-based endpoints to support real-time interactions between clients and the server.
- Session & State Management: Tracks live game sessions, player data, and game state.

Authentication & Authorization:
- User Login/Sign-Up: Endpoints for registration, login, password management, and session/token issuance (e.g., using JWT).
- Access Control: Secure endpoints using middleware that verifies authentication tokens and manages user permissions.

Data Synchronization:
Maintains consistency between the frontend’s view and backend game state through regular updates and event broadcasting.

Integration with Data Layer:
- Fetches and updates player statistics, match history, and session information from the database.
- Utilizes Redis for caching frequently accessed data and maintaining low latency during gameplay.

3.3. Data Layer
Primary Database:
- A relational or NoSQL database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB) for user accounts, match history, game statistics, and authentication credentials.

Caching:
- Redis: Employed for caching player session data, AP status, and other frequently accessed data to improve response times.

Security & Validation:
- Joi: Used for data validation of incoming requests, including authentication data.
- Helmet: Configures HTTP headers to secure Express.js applications.

3.4. Deployment & Orchestration
Containerization:
- Docker: Containerize both frontend and backend services to ensure consistency across development, testing, and production environments.

Orchestration:
- Kubernetes: Manage and scale Docker containers. Leverage Kubernetes features such as auto-scaling, rolling updates, and self-healing to maintain a resilient production environment.

CI/CD Pipeline:
- Tools: GitHub Actions (or equivalent) for automated testing, building, and deployment.
- Process:
  - Build: Trigger builds on code commits, creating Docker images for both the frontend and backend.
  - Test: Run automated unit and integration tests for each build.
  - Deploy: Deploy successful builds to staging, then to production using Kubernetes.

3.5. Monitoring & Logging
Monitoring:
- Prometheus & Grafana: Monitor system performance, resource usage, and real-time metrics across all services.

Logging:
- ELK/EFK Stack: Collect, store, and analyze logs from different system components (Express.js, Kubernetes clusters, Docker containers).
- Winston/Morgan: Implement logging within the backend to capture API request/response details and errors.

4. Data Flow & Interaction
User Interaction: Players interact with the game via the frontend interface, including logging in/signing up and performing game actions. Authentication tokens are stored client-side and sent with API requests for secure communication.

API Request: The frontend sends API/WebSocket requests to the backend for game actions, authentication, and state queries. Requests include user credentials during login or sign-up and game-related actions after authentication.

Game Logic & Authentication Processing: The backend processes game action requests using the game logic module. Authentication requests are processed to verify user credentials and issue secure tokens.

Database & Cache Update: The updated game state and user data (including authentication info) are stored in the primary database. Frequently accessed session and game data are cached in Redis to optimize performance.

Real-Time Feedback: The backend sends real-time updates to all connected clients. The frontend updates the game board, user interface elements, and chat based on these updates.

Monitoring & Logging: All interactions, including authentication events and API calls, are logged. Performance metrics are continuously monitored and displayed on dashboards for operational insights.

5. Security Considerations
- Data Encryption: Secure all API endpoints with HTTPS to protect data in transit.
- Authentication & Authorization: Implement robust user authentication (e.g., OAuth, JWT) to secure user sessions and game integrity. Enforce role-based access control to restrict sensitive operations.
- Input Validation: Use libraries like Joi to validate all incoming data, including login and registration forms.
- Rate Limiting: Apply rate limiting on authentication endpoints and other sensitive routes to prevent abuse.

6. Scalability & Future Enhancements
- Horizontal Scaling: Design backend services and Kubernetes clusters to support horizontal scaling for a growing number of players.
- Microservices Transition: Consider breaking down the monolithic backend into microservices as the game expands.
- Feature Updates: The modular architecture allows for incremental updates (e.g., additional authentication methods, new game mechanics, and enhanced chat features).

7. Conclusion
This architecture aims to provide a scalable, secure, and responsive system for Tank Turn Tactics. The design includes a robust game engine, a dynamic frontend with integrated authentication, and a reliable backend environment, all supported by modern deployment and monitoring strategies.
